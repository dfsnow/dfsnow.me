â™¥ indicates a book I'd wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. For posts and photos, it just indicates one of my favorites.

Also, I made a rating scale for books. It's a 10-point ordinal scale, where 10 is the best and 0 is the worst. It's mostly just to help me remember what I've enjoyed and to give me a consistent, clear scale to reference.

<style type="text/css">
  table .rating {
    text-align:right;
    vertical-align:top;
    font-weight:bold;
    white-space:pre;
    padding:10px 6px 0 0;
  }
  table td {
    padding: 10px 0;
  }
</style>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">10  =</td>
    <td>Flawless. Masterwork that actually permanently changed my point of view on something. Genre/canon defining or introduces entirely new ideas.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">9  =</td>
    <td>Amazing. A favorite book that defines a genre. Leaves me thinking or emotional for days. The type of book I pulled an all-nighter to read. Highlight of the genre.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">8  =</td>
    <td>Great. Extremely fun or moving to read. Made me think. Writing/style/world on point. Couldn't put it down. Memorable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">7  =</td>
    <td>Good. Enjoyed reading it even if imperfect. Time well-spent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">6  =</td>
    <td>Okay. Some reedeming qualities and no regrets about reading it. There's a good book in here somewhere.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">5  =</td>
    <td>Mediocre. Not good or bad, just meh. Wouldn't recommend it and will likely forget about it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">4  =</td>
    <td>Bad. Minor regret that I wasted time reading it. Any good ideas buried by the bad.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">3  =</td>
    <td>Awful. I finished but it was a complete slog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">2  =</td>
    <td>Painful. Big regrets and/or actively mad. Poorly executed, unoriginal garbage or trying way too hard.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">1  =</td>
    <td>Unbearable. Didn't finish the book. Made a good effort but couldn't get more than a few chapters in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="rating">0  =</td>
    <td>No. Only worth burning. Didn't finish and never will. I will remember this book forever for how bad it was.</td>
  </tr>
