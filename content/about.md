Hi there! My name is Dan. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and a Senior Data Scientist at the Cook County Assessorâ€™s Office.

I like to read, rock climb, and hang out with my cat Mimi.

This website is heavily inspired by [Tom MacWright's blog](https://macwright.com/), though it's built from scratch using Hugo, rather than Jekyll. I plan to add my own style shortly.
