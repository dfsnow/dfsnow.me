I hate this book.

I hate it because I can't walk through the egg/dairy aisle of a supermarket without imagining chickens sitting in their own shit in an 8" square cage.

I hate it because, the author, presumably due to his own walk down the same logical path, was able to anticipate and then annihilate my objections and counter-arguments literally as they formed in my mind.

I hate it because it adds one more intractable, impossible problem to the plate of things I care about fixing.

But it's an excellent book, and everyone should read it.
