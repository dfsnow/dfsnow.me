I hate this book.

I hate it because I can't walk through the egg/dairy aisle of a supermarket without imagining chickens sitting in their own shit in an 8" square cage.

I hate it because, the author, presumably due to his own walk down the same logical path, was able to anticipate and then annihilate my objections and counter-arguments literally as they formed in my mind.

I hate it because it adds one more seemingly intractable, impossible problem to the plate of things I should care about fixing.

But I also respect it, because more than anything else, it shocked me out of my own ambivalence toward food and diet.

I've never been someone who cares that much about food. I'll pretty much eat whatever is put in front of me, regardless of whether it is tasty, healthy, or ethical. If I could, I would probably just not eat most of the time, or replace meals with beige paste ala soylent.

But insofar as I do have to eat and soylent is gross and kind of expensive,

Eating Animals is an excellent book, and everyone should read it.
