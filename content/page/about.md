I'm a recent graduate of the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and a Fellow at the [UChicago Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directories/full/fellows). While at Harris, I was a TA or instructor for numerous UChicago classes and workshops related to coding, R, and data science. Prior to Harris, I worked as a data analyst, project manager, and sysadmin in the nonprofit sector.

My research at Harris focused on the supply of physicians and [spatial access to healthcare](https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1629870). I spoke at the Spatial Data Science Conference about [methods for quantifying access to primary care physicians](https://carto.com/blog/spatial-data-science-healthcare-access-model/). I'm currently interested in hospital pricing, social media community formation, and [classifying hate speech using NLP and machine learning](https://github.com/dfsnow/rbans/).

My favorite R packages are ggplot2, lubridate, sf, and tidycensus. I do most of my work in a terminal using tmux and vim (check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dfsnow/dotfiles)). I'm also an avid homelabber; I love building computers and playing with server hardware. Off the web, you can find me biking around Chicago, baking bread, or rock climbing.
