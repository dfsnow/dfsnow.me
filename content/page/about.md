I'm a recent graduate of the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and a Senior Data Scientist at the [Cook County Assessor's Office](http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/). My favorite R packages are ggplot2, lubridate, sf, and tidycensus. I do most of my work in a terminal using tmux and vim (check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dfsnow/dotfiles)). I'm also an avid homelabber; I love building computers and playing with server hardware. Off the web, you can find me biking around Chicago, baking bread, or rock climbing.
