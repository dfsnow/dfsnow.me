I'm a graduate student, research assistant, and teaching assistant at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. My research focuses on healthcare and spatial accessibility. I also work as a data analyst and project manager at a nonprofit organization on Chicago's north side. I like R, Python, data visualization, maps and rock climbing. All opinions are my own.
