I'm a graduate student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. 
I also work as a data analyst and project manager at Chinese Mutual Aid Association, an immigrant-focused social services agency located on Chicago's north side. I like R, Python, data visualization, baking and biking. All opinions are my own.
