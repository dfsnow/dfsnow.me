This is in Orderville Canyon, a side canyon branching off [the Narrows](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm) in Zion National Park.

I did a very dumb thing to get this picture. During the winter, hiking the Narrows requires a dry suit because the entire canyon is filled with near-freezing water.

I stupidly decided to go explore this side canyon alone (my friends were tired). I got more than an hour up the canyon before falling into a pool of water and breaching my suit. I was able to basically speedwalk the 3 hours back to the trailhead/bus without getting too deep into hypothermia, but it was scary. Lesson learned.
