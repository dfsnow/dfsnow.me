A phone took this picture. It was taken using my the astral photography mode of my Pixel 4 at Red River Gorge in Kentucky. I basically propped the phone up with a beer can and let it do its thing for about 10 minutes.

It's not perfect. There's some obvious banding and plenty of noise. But to me, the fact that a phone can now capture a shot like this competely obviates the need to bring along a separate camera. The best camera is the one you have with you and all that.
