Technically this is the [Claude Seymour House](https://chicago.curbed.com/2017/11/20/16671890/uptown-george-maher-claude-seymour-house), one of the most expensive houses in Uptown/Buena Park.

I always laugh when I walk by it though, because at night it looks very spooky and haunted mansion-esque. Lots of houses in Buena Park have that aesthetic for some reason. Maybe Americans' mental image of a haunted house is actually based on things built in the 1910s.
