One thing that surprised me about Hong Kong was the amount of greenspace that was visible from otherwise dense urban areas.

While the amount of greenspace in the city proper seemed lacking, lots of Hong Kong's larger territory is actually undeveloped and reserved for country parks, and you can see those parks from basically everywhere.

The contrast made for lots of interesting pictures, even if actually accessing those parks was a different story (so many hours spent on public transit).
