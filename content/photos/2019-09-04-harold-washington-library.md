The not-so-secret atrium of Harold Washington Library in downtown Chicago.

I came here a lot when I was job-hunting after grad school. It really forces you to work because it's:

* Extremely cold in the winter due to all the glass
* Completely devoid of outlets, so you can't dawdle with a laptop forever
* Usually extremely sparse (as pictured), so you're the center of attention of anyone who enters the room
