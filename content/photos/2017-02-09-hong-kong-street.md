It's funny to contrast this street with the one in [this photo]({{< relref "/photos/2017-02-07-hong-kong-alley.md" >}}).

It's a perfect example of Hong Kong's many contrasts: super fancy high-street vs. grimy alleys, dense urban development vs. beautiful surrounding parks, extreme wealth vs. crushing poverty. You get the idea.
