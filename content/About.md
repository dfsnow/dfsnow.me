I'm a graduate student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. I also work as a data analyst at Chinese Mutual Aid Association, an immigrant-focused social services agency on Chicago's north side. I like R, Python, data visualization, baking and biking. All opinions are my own. You can check out my [GitHub](http://www.github.com/dfsnow) or contact me via [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dfsnow).
